for harwards python course
i was walkin, down the alley, i said wassup, to the boy with glasses.
he was editing his nvim config on his mac with matcha in his hand.
he gave me a disgusted look and mumbled something like
"get lost, bitch. the last time i tried, you were tigher than my indentations."
his pants raised an error. a big one.
i closed his laptop and kissed him.. why? 
probably because he looked so hot.
